Thriae are particularly in tune with bees and often adopt their behaviors, with some even being able to communicate with and call upon bees for assistance. including a formidable stinger and insectoid legs.</p>\n<p>If you want a character with prophetic abilities, thriving in a matriarchal, caste-based society with a strong connection to nature and a deep appreciation for art and craftsmanship, you should play a Thriae.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Be particularly observant of the natural world and its creatures.</li>\n<li>Have a strong affinity for divination and prophecy.</li>\n<li>Be drawn to rare metals and precious stones, incorporating them into your crafts or attire.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Believe you possess cryptic knowledge or hidden secrets.</li>\n<li>Are intrigued by your otherworldly beauty and mystique.</li>\n<li>Assume that your society is secretive and exclusive, with outsiders rarely allowed to participate in Thriae customs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Thriae combine humanoid and bee-like features in a striking and elegant form. Their faces resemble those of humans, but with large, compound eyes in a variety of hues, from dark browns to vibrant greens and blues. A pair of antennae on their foreheads aids in sensing their surroundings and detecting pheromones. Their upper body is humanoid in shape, with two arms and a torso covered in skin that ranges from light to dark tones, often with subtle patterns resembling bees. A chitinous exoskeleton protects their shoulders and upper arms, granting some strong natural armor.</p>\n<p>The lower body of a thriae features a segmented, bee-like abdomen with three pairs of jointed legs, providing exceptional agility and climbing capabilities. Their exoskeleton displays distinct patterns and colors that may vary between hives or individuals. Thriae have four iridescent, membranous wings, which grant them impressive aerial maneuverability. The color and pattern of their wings often<br />reflect their caste or hive affiliation.</p>\n<p>Thriae are medium-sized creatures, with females generally larger and more robust than males. Female Thriae can range from 5 and a half to 6 and a half feet tall, while males are slightly shorter, ranging from 5 to 6 feet tall. Sexual dimorphism is apparent in more pronounced exoskeletal armor and larger wings in females, reflecting their typical roles as warriors and dancers, while males have more slender builds and muted colors, emphasizing their more usual roles as workers, seers and other support roles within the hive; although members of both sexes can be found<br />among the different castes.</p>\n<p>Their unique appearance often evokes curiosity and wonder in those they encounter, and their grace and otherworldly beauty are unmistakable and sometimes uncomfortable to behold. Thriae express emotions in a variety of ways, such as using their antennae to convey subtle shifts in mood or the fluttering of their wings to signal excitement or agitation - something that other ancestries find charming and unnerving in equal measure.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Thriae society is characterized by its highly organized structure, cooperative nature, and complex relationships with other hives and ancestries. Thriae society tends to be insular, but they can form alliances and trade agreements with other ancestries when it benefits them. Individual thriae who choose to venture out into the world are often driven by a personal quest, a vision from their Seer, or a desire to learn more about other cultures. These Thriae may form adventuring parties with other ancestries and develop strong bonds with their companions.</p>\n<p>The thriae caste system is an integral part of their society, providing structure and organization to their hive. Each caste has specific roles and responsibilities that contribute to the overall functioning of the colony. Thriae are assigned to a caste early in their development by the queen, and this assignment defines their purpose and function within the hive.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Thriae are often neutral in alignment, leaning towards lawful due to their structured social order, and they focus on survival and cooperation to ensure the prosperity of their hive above individual concerns. Thriae revere deities associated with nature, fertility, and community who value cooperation and order leading to most religious sects within the hive revering Erastil as his values align with their focus on cooperation, hard work, and their shared connection to nature. Thriae who worship Erastil see themselves as stewards of the land, ensuring their hives remain in harmony with the environment and providing for their community. Family and tradition are highly valued, and Thriae work to ensure their hive remains stable and prosperous for generations to come.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Adventuring thriae most commonly take backgrounds that reflect their connection to nature and their communal way of life such as the bounty hunter, farmer, herbalist, scout or warrior backgrounds. Thriae are agile combatants and prudent adventurers who excel as druids, fighters, monks, rangers, or rogues.</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<p>In Thriae society, naming conventions are closely tied to hivebased roles and castes. Thriae names are derived from several sources, including personal attributes, achievements, naturerelated symbolism, hive origin, and patron deities or spirits. Names incorporating specific terms, prefixes, or suffixes associated with their roles within the hive help to differentiate between individuals and Thriae from different hives may have unique names related to their surroundings and identify their origins. Members of other ancestries often find Thriae names challenging to pronounce due to their unique phonetic structure and emphasis on symbolism. Also, Thriae names often include clicks or buzzing sounds that are difficult for non-Thriae to replicate and so a more simplified version of names is often used in communication with outsiders.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Sample Names</span></h3>\n<p>Alveo, Apius, Arkos, Bastyl, Celdra, Harsa, Kivis, Melixa, Melyr, Nektara, Opetra, Pollis, Rhoset, Rhexa, Sylki, Xylin, Zephy, Zorix, Zosiri, Zylis</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Thriae Mechanics</h2>\n<p><strong>Hit Points</strong> 8</p>\n<p><strong>Size</strong> Medium</p>\n<p><strong>Speed</strong> 25 feet</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Boosts</strong> Dexterity, Free</p>\n<p><strong>Languages</strong> Common, Strix</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Languages</strong> equal to your Intelligence modifier (if positive).
